Emotion AI : Facial Keypoints Detection

In this project from Coursera Project Network, we build a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to detect facial keypoints. This project can be used for several applications including vehicle cabin monitoring, emotion analysis and detecting customer emotions.
